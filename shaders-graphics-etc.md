    * 1:50:00 - Dot product of 2 normalized vectors, `vertext normal` and `direction to light source` gives approximation of diffuse
    * 1:53:00 Can interpret dot product as how similar 2 vectors are
        * Perpendicular: 0. Opposite direction: -1
        * (re: Lambert shading; is not Lambert yet with this alone)
